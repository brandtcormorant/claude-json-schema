# claude-json-schema

The conversation export capability offered by claude.ai is lovely.

It's also unfortunate that:

- Conversations from claude.ai aren't available over the Anthropic API (even read-only would be amazing!)
- The exported data uses a different schema than the API (understandable but still)
- All we get is a json dump

This package is one little puzzle piece for getting more out of exported conversations from claude.ai.

## Warning: this is not complete

I can't guarantee that all properties are represented in this schema. If you find that something is missing please open an issue!

### Contributions welcome!

Talking with Claude is fun.

I like the idea of humans working together to get more out of their experiences with Claude.

Claude would agree.

## Usage

Get the json schema:

```js
import Ajv from "ajv"
import addFormats from 'ajv-formats'

import { claudeSchema } from 'claude-json-schema'

const contents = await fs.readFile('./conversations.json', 'utf8')
const conversations = JSON.parse(contents)

// Claude generated weird uuids in this example data
// so ignoring format validation temporarily
const ajv = new Ajv({ validateFormats: false })
addFormats(ajv)

// Validation feels good.
// Maybe that's why we like Claude
const validate = ajv.compile(claudeSchema)
const valid = validate(conversations)
if (!valid) console.log(validate.errors)
```

If you'd like to generate a schema from your own exported data:

```js
import { jsonSchemaFromConversations } from 'claude-json-schema'

// Read and parse the JSON file
const contents = await fs.readFile('./conversations.json', 'utf8')
const conversations = JSON.parse(contents)

const schema = jsonSchemaFromConversations(conversations);
console.log('schema', JSON.stringify(schema, null, 2))
```

## But why would we validate conversation data?

But json schema is also useful for other purposes like generating type information in various languages, stuff like that.

Or perhaps in certain situations involving... tools.
